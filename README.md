# Number Wizard
A fun Python game where the computer guesses your number.

## How It Works

1. The player selects a number between 0 and 100.
2. The program attempts to guess the number.
3. The player gives hints by typing:
    - `up`: If the number is higher than the program's guess.
    - `down`: If the number is lower than the program's guess.
4. The program continues guessing until it finds the correct number.

## Features
